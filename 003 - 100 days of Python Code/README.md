# 100 days of python code

Here you will find all the projects I have done during the 100 days of python code challenge.

## General information
- Day 6 was in an external platform and so it's not included here.
- Since I'm using a `venv`, I use the following function to open files from the current directory:
    ```python
    from os import path

    def dir(file_name):
        return path.join(path.dirname(__file__), file_name)
    ```
